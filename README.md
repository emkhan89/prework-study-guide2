# Prework Study Guide webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript and delves into my first attempt into the world of front end web development.

This project was built to document my journey from its infancy. Sometimes we lose sight of how far we have come because of the problems that are in front of us. Maybe one day i'll look back at this and think "how on earth did i find any of this so difficult!?"

Documenting my journey is important in reminding me of the challenges that i faced on not only this project but future projects also. Previous experiences are vital in informing our problem solving choices in the future.  

I learnt about the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. There is a great number of commands to learn but im sure these will all become second nature with the passage of time and practice. Also, i learnt the importance of iteration and how that can help develop your understanding. For example, h1 and h2 refer to the sizes of text for each heading.
